This question had me baffled for quite some time, so here's a short explanation.

The problem is, we need to randomly pick an index proportional to its weight.
What does this mean?

We have a weighted array, each
weight[i] represents weight of index i. 
The more the weight is, higher the chances of getting that index randomly.

Ex:
Suppose weights = [1, 3]
then 3 is larger, so there is a higher chance to get index 1.

We can know the chance of selecting each index by knowing its probability.

P(i) = weight[i]/totalWeight

totalWeight = 1 + 3 = 4
So, for index 0, P(0) = 1/4  = 0.25 = 25%
for index 1, P(1) = 3/4 = 0.75 = 75%

So, there is a 25% of chance to pick index 0 and 75% chance to pick index 1.
